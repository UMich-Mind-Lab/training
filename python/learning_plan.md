# Learning plan

This is the Google doc that Natasha started.

[Python training (Natasha, Jaedyn and Bennet)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DTnPJiEFk6gFlQ709BNnKHbNOQ_florB8ZxI7ItkKtc/edit)

## Week 1

Review and complete the material on Real Python in the following
lessons.  Record approximately how much time it took for each for
use in estimating how much time subsequent lessons or projects
might take.

[Variables in Python](https://realpython.com/courses/variables-python/)

[Strings and Character Data in Python](https://realpython.com/courses/python-strings/)

Take the quiz associated with each.  Was the quiz helpful?  Did you have
to refer back to documention, Google, or the lesson to answer the
questions?  Do we need to go over this material more before we move
on?

# Looking ahead and supplemental tutorials or lessons

There is useful information here, but it is probably too much detail
to start.

Python lists hold multiple values under a single 'name' and are what
we are likely to work with the most.

Next most common multiple value variable is a dictionary.
